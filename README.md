Make sure [Backend](https://github.com/JakobWestergardenIkea/interviewtask-be) is running

## TODO
- Style the pages using Skapa components
- Dynamic component scaling based on resolution
- Handle errors from backend
- Add icon with color when choosing colors (add hexcode in colours collection for this)
- Add icon of specific product types
- Extract the dropdown menu and place styles there
- Add loading states with loading button until API calls are resolved
